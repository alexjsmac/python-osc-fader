# python-osc-fader
A very simple fader made with tkinter to send a continuous OSC signal to Wekinator.

## What it could be used for
I liked this for control of the [Processing_Drum_3ContinuousOutputs](https://github.com/fiebrink1/wekinator_examples/tree/master/outputs/Processing/Processing_Drum_3ContinuousOutputs). The fader could be used to set the overall complexity of the drum beat.

## How to run
* Set up wekinator with 1 input and whatever outputs you'll need
* Run `python2.7 fader_osc_controller.py`
* Use your mouse to move the fader up and down
